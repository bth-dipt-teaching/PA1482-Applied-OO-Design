- Design Patterns and Design Principles
- Getting Started [with Java and C++]
* Object Oriented Programming
** Background: Data Representation and Manipulation
- Computer Programs are essentially about /Data/, e.g.
  - Text
  - Bank Account Information
  - Demographics
  - Warehouse Inventory
  - Medical Journals
  - Collections of Live or Historical Measurements from some device
  - Images, Video, \dots
  - Maps
  - \dots
- Some data only exist within the realm of a computer program
- Other (most) data represent something in the real world

Challenges
- /Represent/ the data accurately
- /Manipulate/ the data consistently
- /Store/ data sufficiently durably
** Representing Data
- Simple datatypes: /int, float, char/
- Compound datatype: /person, bank account, text document, position/

Challenge
- We usually do not only store /one/ datum; we have collections of data, e.g.
  - /temperature readings every minute for the past 24 hours/
  - /persons currently employed by this company/
  - /patients in Sweden/
** Manipulate Data
- Program Structuring ensure that all code that manipulates a certain type of data is found in the same place.
  - All code that manipulates /X/ is in this directory.
  - All code that manpulates /X/ is in this file.
  - All code that manipulates /X/ have the moniker ~X~ in their name.
  - \dots
  - /Only/ code with an ~X~ in their name is allowed to operate on /X/.
  - code with an ~X~ in their name is only allowed to operate on a single instance of /X/.
  - \dots 
- The data representation may make it easier or harder to manipulate the data /consistently/.
  - All parts of /X/ start with ~X~ , .e.g. ~PersonName~, ~PersonPhoneNumber~, ~PersonAddress~,
  - Position ~i~ in all collections represent part of the same datum, e.g. ~PersonName[1]~ has the corresponding ~PersonPhoneNumber[1]~.

Or, we may take a different approach.
** Objects: Representing Compound Data Types
#+begin_src c
  struct Person {
    char name[50];
    char phoneNumber[20];
    struct Address address;
  };

  struct Person p1;
#+end_src

#+begin_src javascript
  let p1 = {
      name: "",
      phoneNumber: "",
      address: {},
  };
#+end_src

- In both these examples, we have created an /Object/ ~p1~.
- ~p1~ contains three datum, name, phoneNumber, and address.
- We can create another Object, ~p2~ which may contain a different name, phoneNumber, and address.
- In fact, we can create a whole collection of ~Person~ objects.
** Objects: Encapsulating Behaviour
- This is a nifty extension to the built-in data types, we can now create our own types.

However:
- we still have to keep track of where we put the code to manipulate these data.
- all data is still available to anyone, we cannot protect access.

*Encapsulation*
- Cleaner public interfaces of object/class/package/subsystem/system/service
- Protect data from unsanctioned access
- Focus each object/class on /their/ task, remain unaware of other objects and tasks.
- /Easy To Change/

Example: How to get from /Victoria Station/ to /Paddington Station/? 
- Know every road and roadblock along the way?
- Know the bus-routes that will take you there?
- Know which tube-line to board?
- Know how to wave down a taxi?

- /Do not/ know how to drive a car in London traffic.
- /Do not/ know whether there is enough fuel in the taxi.
- /Do not/ know how other travellers will get there, their names, or anything else about them.
** Classes describe Objects
- Java and C++ are /typed languages/
- Every item of data must have a type
- At the very basic level it is used to allocate sufficient memory for the data item.
- The language enforces type consistency, if you'll let it.
  - (A ~Person~ can only be accessed as a person and not e.g. as a ~Car~ ).

- Developer-defined data type ≃ *Class*
- describes the structure of the data type
- gathers methods (functions) that operate on the data.
- Encapsulates methods and parts of the data type to create a cleaner interface.
- /Blueprint for creating objects/
- /Description for what a developer may do with an object/
- The programming language helps developers to "stick to the script"
** One Class, many Objects
#+begin_src java
  public class Person {
    private String name;
    private String phoneNumber;
    private Address address;

    // Constructors and methods
    // ...
  }

  // ...
  Person p1 = new Person("Ada", "1", "Newstead Abbey");
  Person byron = new Person("George Gordon", "0", "Newstead Abbey");
  Person[] students = new Person[25];
  System.out.println(new Person("Coleridge", "2", "Coleridge Cottage"));
#+end_src

- Same class is used to create many objects
- Each object contains the same attributes (variables), but with their own values.
- Each object contains the same set of methods (functions).
- Each object contains all the necessary data to describe /one and only one/ instance of that type.
- You /may/ have a variable that reference an object.
- The name of this variable is unknown to the object itself.
- The variable name can (and often will) change as you pass an object around.
** Summary
- *We use objects to represent the real world.*
  - *Reduced cognitive gap (Real World Object \Leftrightarrow Object in Computer Program)*
- Classes describe Objects
- Classes, or Types, are necessary in programming languages such as Java or C++.
  - Encapsulates a compound data type
  - Encapsulates associated behaviour

- Object Oriented Programming with Classes is /one/ language design choice
  - Other languages (e.g. JavaScript) do not /need/ classes but they help readability and maintainability.
  - Other languages (e.g. Clojure) do not encapsulate behaviour together with data
    - focus instead on describing data types and their relations
    - made possible because data is immutable && code structure is enforced in other ways.
* Object Oriented Analysis and Design
** Growing Systems
- OOP is a good start, but as systems grow we run into challenges.

- Which Real World Objects should be represented as Program Objects?
- What are the responsibilities for each object?
- Which Objects need to collaborate to solve some task?
- How to get an overview of all the classes?
- What hinders maintainability? What facilitates maintainability?
- How to make best use of the entire toolchain, including the programming language itself?

- Object Oriented Analysis
  - Problem domain and requirements
  - /Objects/ in the problem domain
- Object Oriented Design
  - Logical Software Objects (with attributes and methods, plus collaborations)
- OO Construction/Implementation
** Discuss: Why Bother About Modelling :Discussion:

T. Gorschek, E. Tempero, L. Angelis, /On the use of software design
models in software development practice: An empirical investigation/,
in Journal of Systems and Software 95(2014):176--193.

- TL;DR: Nearly 4000 industry practitioners were asked "Do you model?".
- Answers ranged from "no" to "hell no!".
- \dots *There is, of course, more to this story.*

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 600
  [[./ISurveyModelling.png]]
** Why Bother About Modelling
- In the freetext answers a different story emerges:
  - They do use sketches, informal models, casual diagrams, etc, but not formal UML.
- Common explanations:
  - "Only for very complex designs, sometimes"
  - "Only use initially then start coding (diagrams not kept/updated)"
  - "Enables visualisation of the big picture/high level"
  - "Other types of models but not UML"
  - "Use models to communicate and coordinate with other developers"

\sum Models are not used as researchers expect.
- Instead they are used for *conceptual analysis and exploration, problem solving, visualisation, and communication.*
** RUP/UML
- Unified Modelling Language (*UML*)
  - A traceable chain of different models from requirements to code/test.
    - Each model is transformed to a [more detailed] model that is closer to the end-product.
    - Do this fully, and you have /Model-Driven Development/ (Which we won't do in this course)
  - UML is /one/ set of models; there are many others, especially for different domains.

- Rational Unified Process (*RUP*)
  - the process used to, whith the help of UML diagrams step by step increase the understanding of which system to build.

Process:
1. *Understand Requirements* Use Case Diagrams / Use Cases
2. *Understand Problem Domain* Conceptual Model / Domain Model
3. *Translate from /user actions/ to /system calls/.* System Sequence Diagram 
4. *Describe /Object Interactions/.* Sequence Diagrams / Interaction Diagrams
5. *Establish an overview over what to build* Class Diagram
6. *Gradually build the system* Goto (4)

In this course, we focus on /Interacting Objects/ and the corresponding /Class Diagram/.
* Design Patterns and Design Principles
** Design Patterns
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 500
[[./IPolhem.jpg]]
(Christopher Polhem, /Mekaniskt Alfabet/, ca 1697)

- Design patterns are /reusable solutions to known problems/
  - \dots with known consequences
- There is nothing that /requires/ you to use design patterns; they are a convenience.
- Design patterns focus primarily on structure (class view), and interaction (sequence diagrams)
** Design Principles
- Fundamendal Object Oriented "rules" for how to create a flexible and maintainable design.
  - "They're more like guidelines, really..."
- As opposed to Design Patterns, you use these /all the time/ and /implicitly/.

- Responsibility Driven Design ::
  - Principles for assigning responsibility for /knowing/ or /doing/ to the right object.
  - Overall goal: Easy To Change (ETC)

** When & Where
- Design Principles are used whether you have made an explicit object oriented design or not.
  - They can be seen in the design, but will be equally important when you jump straight into programming.
- Design Patterns are /more often/ designed first and implemented second.
- Design Patterns are especially important in "classic" object oriented languages.
  - Less important (but still useful) in duck-typed languages such as JavaScript or Clojure.
  - (Clojure in particular takes a completely different path to achieve the same flexibility.)

* Getting Started without an IDE
** Compiled Languages
- Java and C++ are /compiled/ languages
  - A tool translates your source code into something machine readable /before/ you run it.
  - \dots as opposed to e.g. Python, PHP, or JavaScript, where a tool /interprets/ your source code at runtime.
- This adds a few steps to the toolchain, i.e. =write \rightarrow compile \rightarrow maybe-more-compilation \rightarrow run=
- If you use a modern IDE you probably do not have to worry too much about this.

Benefits
- Efficiency (performance /and/ e.g. memory efficiency)
- Compiler will syntax-check /all/ your code before you deploy
  - /s/runtime errors/compiation errors/ -- Fix your code before you deploy
  - Fosters a more stringent approach to programming
- Source code is not accessible to end-users
- Smaller size of shipped program
- Access to low-level APIs on your computer, e.g. Operating System, CPU, network, disk, memory, etc.

Challenges
- Compiled code /may/ be platform dependent (C++ is, Java isn't)
- More complex toolchain
- Difficult to edit a running program on the fly
- Some programming language constructs are difficult to achieve, e.g. homoiconicity.
  - (But not impossible; Clojure accomplishes this)
** Basic Steps
Java
1. Write Java Source Code
2. *Compile* to machine independent =bytecode=
3. *Interpret* =bytecode=

Optional: Package the bytecode files into a ~JAR~ file.

C/C++
1. Write Source Code
2. *Compile* to =runnable binary= or =relocatable machine code=
3. *Link* relocatable machine code to a =runnable binary=
4. *Run* the =runnable binary=
** Getting Started with Java
0. [@0] Appendix E in Barnes and Kölling
1. Make sure you have a JDK/JRE installed
2. Start a terminal
3. use ~javac~ to compile a ~.java~ file
   - ~javac Start.java~
4. use ~java~ to run a ~.class~ file
   - ~java Start~

Basic rules:
- Each class is defined in a file /with the same name as the class/
  - Class names are in principle case sensitive (lower/upper case letters)
  - In practice, some filesystems are not; this may create problems.
  - \Rightarrow Use proper and unique names, and make sure the file and class are spelled the same way.
- The "root" Class, where you want the program to start /must/ have a ~main()~ function:

#+begin_src java
  public class Start {

    public static void main(String [] args) {
    }

  }
#+end_src

- It is good practice to keep this function /very/ small; a simple printout and an object creation or two.
** Getting Started with C++
1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed.
2. Start a terminal
3. Use your compiler (e.g. ~g++~) to compile your ~.cc~ and ~.hh~ files.
   - ~g++ start.cc -o start~
4. Run the resulting program as usual:
   - ~./start~

Basic Rules:
- The compiler doesn't care, but:
  - keep /class declaration/ in a ~.hh~ - file
  - keep /class definition/ in a ~.cc~ file with the same name as the ~.hh~ file.
- /somewhere/ in the compiled program there must be a ~main()~ function.

#+begin_src c++
  int main() {
    // ...
    return 0;
  }
#+end_src

- It is good practice to keep this function /very/ small; a simple printout and an object creation or two.
- It is also good practice to keep this function in an easily recognisable file, e.g. ~main.cc~ or ~start.cc~ .
** Build Tools (multi-file project)
- ~javac~ will follow class dependencies until it encounters a class that does not need to be compiled (source code unchanged).
- C++ compiler will just do one file at the time.
- Can use wildcards ~javac *.java~ to re-build everything.

Build tools save time
- Your IDE can help you (e.g. a project in Visual Studio)
- Be a Good Friend (TM), create a ~makefile~.
  - https://makefiletutorial.com/

#+begin_src makefile
VARIABLE = value

target: dependency
  Command to build target
#+end_src

** Generic makefile for Java
#+begin_src makefile
JAVAC=javac
sources = $(wildcard *.java)
classes = $(sources:.java=.class)

all: myProgram

clean:
	$(RM) *.class

run: myProgram
	java Start

myProgram: $(classes)

%.class: %.java
	$(JAVAC) $<
#+end_src
** Generic makefile for C++
#+begin_src makefile
CC = g++
CFLAGS = -g -Wall
INCLUDE = -I.
TARGET=myProgram
EXT = .cc
SRCS = $(wildcard *$(EXT))
OBJS = $(SRCS:$(EXT)=.o)


all: $(TARGET)

run: $(TARGET)
	./$(TARGET)

$(TARGET): $(OBJS)
	$(CC) -o $@ $^ $(CFLAGS) $(INCLUDE) $(LDFLAGS) $(LIBS)

%.o : %$(EXT)
	$(CC) -c $< -o $@ $(CFLAGS) $(INCLUDE)

clean:
	$(RM) $(OBJS) $(TARGET)
#+end_src

- This will get you started, but the build file will need to be extended.
- Note that changes to ~.hh~ files will not be considered with this. Options:
  - Explicitly define ~DEPS= file1.hh file2.hh~ (bad idea)
  - Make sure you touch the right ~.cc~ - file (better idea, but may miss places where the file is included)
  - Plan your classes and APIs beforehand to minimise changes (even better idea)
  - Advanced =makefile-fu= to fix this once and for all with ~g++ -M~ .
** Summary
- For now, =BlueJ= is a good abstraction to learn Object Orientation.

- Grok the command line interface
  - Increase your understanding of what is really going on
  - Will help you later in your career
  - Will enable you to work with build systems
  - Easier to share your project with troglodytes who refuse to use a modern IDE.
- In an IDE, much of this is hidden.

- Read the error messages!
* Lost Puppies :noexport:
** Objects using other Objects
- We have already introduced one example: /compound data types may consist of other compound data types/
  - ~struct Person { ... struct Address address; };~

#+begin_src c  
  struct Seat {
    bool isBooked;
    int seatNumber;
    struct Person passenger;
  };

  struct Flight {
    struct Person pilots[2];    
    struct Seat seats[100];
  };  

  bool isFlightFull(struct Flight *theFlight) {
    int seatNumber = 0;
    while (seatNumber < 100 && theFlight->seats[seatNumber++].isBooked) { }
    return (seatNumber == 100);
  }
#+end_src

(There is a lot to unpack here, we will come back to this later in the course)
