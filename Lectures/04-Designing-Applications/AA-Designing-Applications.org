* Discussion: Classes and Attributes :Discussion:
   - How can we find / What are:
     - Classes
     - Attributes
     - Associations
   - What is the difference between an /Attribute/ and a /Class/
* Identifying Classes
   | Category              | Examples  |                    |
   |-----------------------+-----------+--------------------|
   | Physical Objects      | POST      | Aeroplane          |
   | Places                | Store     | Aerport            |
   | Transactions          | Payment   | Reservation        |
   | Containers            | Basket    | Aeroplane          |
   | Things in Container   | Item      | Passenger          |
   | Events                | Sale      | Flight             |
   | Description of Things | Sale Item | Flight Description |
   | Records, Contracts    | Receipt   | Ticket             |
   |-----------------------+-----------+--------------------|
* Finding Classes
   - Look for /nouns/
   - /verbs/ may be methods on the nouns.
     - On what noun does the verb operate?

   Sources:     
   - Textual description of problem domain
   - Requirements
   - Use-cases

   Cave!
   - Natural language is ambiguous
   - Class or Attribute? Decide for now, may change later.
* Scenarios and Responsibilities
- Walk through what needs to happen in the system to solve a particular task.
- A team can "role play" as objects in a scenario.
- Start with a simple high-level description
- Follow the execution to define /Responsibilities/ , methods, and new classes.

#+begin_quote
A customer calls the cinema and wants to make a reservation for two
seats tonight to watch the movie /Ben Hur/. The cinema employee uses the
booking system to find and reserve two seats on the third row.
#+end_quote

1. Which class do we start with? =BookingSystem=
2. What do we do? =search for show by title and day=
   - ~search()~ is a method on ~BookingSystem~
   - ~Show~ is a new class which we did not see in the initial description.
3. How does ~BookingSystem~ find the shows?
   - =BookingSystem= already has one responsibility: Interface with the cinema employee
   - Better to delegate management of shows to another class: ~ShowCollection~

\dots and so on. *Discuss* what is the next step?
* More on class Responsibilities
- Design Principle: /High Cohesion/

The methods and attributes in a class should all work within
 a /small and well-defined area of responsibility/.

- More responsibilities \rightarrow more methods that do not work on the same underlying data
- Add new classes instead
* Attributes
   - Logical value of an element
     - Examples: /name, quantity, status, .../
     - Hint: Builtin data types
       - String, int, date
       - But also simple user-defined types such as /address, personnummer, .../
   - *Keep Attributes Simple*
* Associations
   An association is a
   - relationship between concepts
   - indicates a meaningful and interesting connection

   Types
   - Need-to-know (preserved for some time; needs to maintained by software)
   - Comprehension-only (used to understand domain)
* Finding Associations
   | Category                       | Examples                    |
   |--------------------------------+-----------------------------|
   | A -- is a part of -- B         | Salesitem -- Sale           |
   |                                | Wing -- Aeroplane           |
   | A -- is contained in -- B      | Item -- Store               |
   |                                | Seat -- Flight              |
   | A -- is a description for -- B | ItemDescription -- Item     |
   |                                | FlightInformation -- Flight |
   | A -- is known/recorded in -- B | Sale -- POST                |
   |                                | Booking -- Flight           |
   | A -- is owned by -- B          | Store -- Company            |
   | A -- related transactions -- B | Payment -- Sale             |
   |                                | Booking -- Ticket           |
   |--------------------------------+-----------------------------|
* Discussion: Multiplicity :Discussion:
- One object of type A has an association to a number of objects of type B

#+begin_src plantuml :file CD-Multiplicity.png
A - B

Customer - Ticket
#+end_src     

#+RESULTS:
[[file:CD-Multiplicity.png]]

- one to one A -- B
- one to specific number A -- "5" B
- one to range A -- "1..10" B
- one to at least one A -- "+" B
- one to at least specific number A -- "10+" B
- one to any number A -- "*" B
- many to many A "10" -- "5" B

- /Always look at multiplicity from the perspective of a single object/
* More on Classes and Objects
- Real world is full of /Objects/ and no classes
- A /Class/ is a collective description of objects that look the same or
  behave in the same way

- When a new object is introduced, we have the choice to:
  1. Create a new object of an existing class, e.g. ~new Ticket()~
     and set the attributes on this new object to whatever makes this object unique.
  2. Create a complete new class to describe this new object,
     then create a new object based on this new class.
  3. Inherit from an existing class and only define what differs.
     then create a new object based on this new sub-class.

- Either way, there are a few terms we need to keep in mind:
  - The /name of the variable/ in which we store a reference to the object
    - This doesn't really have anything to do with the actual object.
  - The /Class/ we use as a template for the object
  - The /attributes/ that a class declares that an object must have
  - The /values/ of the attributes in an object
    - *These values can be, and often are, references to other objects.*

- Interactions between objects are modelled as associations between classes
#+begin_src plantuml :file OD-Interacting.png
object "anne:Customer" as anne
note top : Why is "anne" a bad name for this variable?
object "bob:Customer" as bob
object "t1:Ticket" as ticket
note right : Why is "t1" almost as bad?

anne : name="Anne"
bob : name="Bob"
ticket : movie="Spartacus"
ticket : date="tonight"
ticket : time="19:00"

anne -- ticket
bob -- ticket

Class Customer
Customer : -name:String
Class Ticket
Ticket : -movie:String
Ticket : -date:Date
Ticket : -time:Time

** Use Cases
  - The starting scenario we used earlier
  - More details on the specific interaction

#+begin_quote
*Use Case* Reserve Seats for Show
*Actors* Customer, Cinema Employee
*Desciption* A customer calls the cinema and wants to make a reservation for two
seats tonight to watch the movie /Ben Hur/. The cinema employee uses the
booking system to find and reserve two seats on the third row.

*Main Course of Events*
| Actor                                                         | System                                 |
|---------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------|
| 1. The employee searches for showings of "Ben Hur" today      |                                        |
|                                                               | 2. The system lists all shows          |
| 3. The employee asks the customer which show they wish to see |                                        |
| 4. The employee selects the "19:00" show.                     |                                        |
|                                                               | 5. The system lists available seats.   |
| 6. The employee asks the customer how many seats they want    |                                        |
| and where they want to sit.                                   |                                        |
| 7. The employee selects two seats on the third row.           |                                        |
|                                                               | 8. The system reserves the two seats.  |
|                                                               | 9. The system confirms the reservation |
|                                                               | and returns a reservation code.        |
| 10. The employee gives the reservation code to the customer   |                                        |
| and ends the all.                                             |                                        |

* Introducing Design Patterns
** Christopher Polhem, father of Design Patterns?
#+ATTR_LATEX: :height 6cm
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 600
[[file:./IPolhem.jpg]]
** Patterns -- a brief introduction
  - Design patterns are reusable solutions to known problems
    - With known consequences
    - "encoded experience"
    - Codified in a structured format
    - named
  - There is nothing that /requires/ you to use design patterns; they are a convenience.
  - Design patterns focus primarily on structure (class view), and interaction (sequence diagrams).

 *Responsibility Driven Design*
** Some Common Design Patterns
From Gamma, E., Helm, R., Johnson, R., & Vlissides, J., /Design
patterns: elements of reusable object-oriented languages and systems/
(1994), Reading MA: Addison-Wesley.

  1. Strategy
  2. State
  3. Observer
  4. Facade, Wrapper, Adapter
  5. Abstract Facory
  6. Singleton
  7. Builder
  8. Command
  9. Interpreter
  10. Visitor

 Barnes and Kölling, Ch15:
- Decorator \approx Facade, Adapter
- Singleton
- Factory Method \in Abstract Factory
- Observer
** Exampe: Decorator Pattern
- Commonly used in Java APIs
- A more low-level API class is /decorated/ with a more advanced set of methods.

#+begin_src plantuml :file DP-Decorator.png
BufferedReader - Reader : Decorates >

Reader : +boolean ready()
Reader : +int read()
Reader : +int read(char [] cbuf)
Reader : +void reset()

BufferedReader : +BufferedReader(Reader in)
BufferedReader : +String readLine()
BufferedReader : +boolean ready()
BufferedReader : +int read()
BufferedReader : +int read(char [] cbuf)
BufferedReader : +void reset()
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:DP-Decorator.png]]

- Yes, ~BufferedReader~ is an extension of ~Reader~
  - that adds a few methods such as ~readLine()~
  - we will introduce Inheritance soon.
