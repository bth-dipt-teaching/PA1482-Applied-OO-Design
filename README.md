 - [Course Syllabus](https://edu.bth.se/utbildning/utb_kursplaner.asp?sok=pa1482)
 - 6 ECTS, LP 3
 - Programs:
   - Civilingenj√∂rsprogrammet i Mjukvaruteknik (2nd semester)
 - Team:

This is a 6 ECTS course offered by [Blekinge Institute of Technology](https://www.bth.se). 
The purpose of the course is to offer knowledge in
object oriented design applied in an object oriented
programming language, in part for further software
engineering studies and in part to be able to solve
generic programming tasks as an industry
professional.
  
The course consists of Lectures and Assignments.

## Learning Outcomes
The following learning outcomes are examined in the course:
  1. **Knowledge and understanding**;  On completion of the course, the student will be able to:
     - In depth explain basic concepts and techniques in object oriented programming and design.
     - Understand and in depth explain design and program code for a simple object oriented system.
  2. **Competence and skills**;  On completion of the course, the student will be able to:
     - Structure a problem solution for a smaller system with the help of classes and present it in a class diagram.
     - Apply design patterns to create a maintainable object oriented design.
     - Implement a small object oriented system according to a specific design.
     - Use the standard libraries for the programming language.
  3. **Judgement and approach**;  On completion of the course, the student will be able to:
     - Analyse and discuss a design and program code for potential improvements.
